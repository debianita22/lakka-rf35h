/* hydraulics_stub.s -- mid-function stubs for the hydraulics camera fix.
 *
 * In a lowrider with hydraulics the right analog stick tilts the car and the
 * camera is locked. This lets R3 toggle a "camera mode" (g_hydraulics_camera,
 * defined in game.c; default 0 = stock tilt) in which the stick moves the camera
 * instead. Three stubs, all gated on that flag:
 *
 *  - hyd_freeze_stub: hooked at CAutomobile::HydraulicControl+0x4cc (0x6a2458).
 *    When camera mode is on, GetHydraulicJump (see game.c) returns 1 so the engine
 *    skips reading the stick for tilt and reaches here to apply the suspension. We
 *    don't want to touch the hydraulics at all -- just freeze them where they are --
 *    so we branch straight to +0xb50 (0x6a2adc), the same "not a hydraulics car, do
 *    nothing" path the function's own gate takes, which cleanly returns without
 *    changing the suspension. In tilt mode we reproduce the clobbered 4 instrs
 *    (ending in `cmp w8,#0x1f4`, whose flags the next instr uses) and rejoin at
 *    +0x4d0 (0x6a2468).
 *
 *  - aim_lr_stub / aim_ud_stub: hooked at CPad::AimWeaponLeftRight+0xa0 (0x49fdcc)
 *    and CPad::AimWeaponUpDown+0x94 (0x4a019c). The car camera reads the right
 *    stick through these; in a hydraulics car they early-return 0 on the
 *    "hydraulics installed" flag (veh+0x4BA bit1), locking the camera. In camera
 *    mode we skip that early-return so the stick reaches the camera. TWO conditional
 *    branches (`cbz x0` on a null vehicle, and `b.ne` when GetInputType()!=1) target
 *    the `str xzr,[sp]` that our hook overwrites; BOTH are NOP'd in game.c so control
 *    falls through into this stub instead of jumping into the hook's trampoline bytes
 *    (leaving either un-NOP'd crashes with an Undefined Instruction -- the b.ne fires
 *    transiently at load). The x0==null case is handled here (label 2f). We then
 *    reproduce `str xzr,[sp]` and the `bl CHID::GetInputType` (by pre-loading x30 with
 *    the rejoin address and tail-branching to GetInputType, so its ret lands there).
 *
 * Written in .s for the same reasons as fov_stub.s (naked is ignored by this GCC;
 * hidden globals keep adrp/:lo12: PIC-valid). The runtime target addresses and the
 * GetInputType pointer are resolved in game.c's patch_game(). x17 is dead on entry
 * (the hook_arm64 trampoline uses it) and used here as scratch; x30 is restored
 * from AimWeapon's own stack frame in its epilogue, so clobbering it is safe.
